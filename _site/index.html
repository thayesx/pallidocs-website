          <p id="p2">But with crisis comes an opportunity to find new meaning. Old wounds may become new openings. One can see the world through the eyes of the heart.</p>

    <h1>Intentional Healing</h1>
    <p>Intentional Healing is a restorative documentary that follows the famed Nashville music producer Jesse Boyce as he contemplates his own mortality following a diagnosis of terminal prostate cancer. He returns to the studio as an artist, producer and mentor to compose one last song with Black Violin. The film demonstrates the healing power of music and candidly depicts 21st-century cancer care in Music City. To Jesse, hope is a lasting belief that life will be fine regardless of the outcome; joy is independent of the journey.</p>
