  paragraphs:
  - Thinking about what matters most in your life and sharing your hopes and fears
    will give you more control over the care you receive in the future. It will also
    help your loved ones to make decisions for you if you can’t make them at some
    point down the road.
  - This is the beginning of an ongoing discussion, however, we believe that individuals  who
    think about what is important to them often feel more control of their situation,
    feel less anxious and reach a sense of peace.
  quote: To speak of sorrow works upon it, Moves it from its crouched place, barring
    the way to and from the soul’s hall<br>- Denise Levertov
  ask: 'Would you feel comfortable taking a few minutes to document your goals and
    wishes?'
