paragraphs:
- "The emotions that follow a serious illness can be difficult to express. It is an
  experience that will force a person to reckon with their ultimate goals in life.
  Each new moment shifts the balance between grace and uncertainty, between faith
  and doubt. \n\n "
- 'But along with crisis comes the opportunity to find new meaning. Old wounds become
  new openings and we begin to see the world through the eyes of the heart. '
- 'These Films and Reflections are meant to honor a community built on strength and
  fellowship. They are intended to remind us that our lives matter and that we are
  not alone. '
- 'We hope they can inspire a conversation, evoke an emotion and remind us that joy
  can be found in unexpected ways. '
- Sincerely,<br><br> John Stavas<br> Cody Huff<br> Sara Martin, MD<br> Mohana Karlekar,

    for outreach and education.'

  description: Intentional Healing is a restorative documentary that follows the famed
    Nashville music producer Jesse Boyce as he contemplates his own mortality following
    a diagnosis of terminal prostate cancer. He returns to the studio as an artist,
    producer and mentor to compose one last song with Black Violin. The film demonstrates
    the healing power of music and candidly depicts 21st-century cancer care in Music
    City. To Jesse, hope is a lasting belief that life will be fine regardless of
    the outcome; joy is independent of the journey.
