paragraphs:
- The emotions that come with a serious diagnosis can be hard to manage. It's an experience
  that will force anyone to reckon with their goals in lifeâ€”while each moment can
  shift the balance between uncertainty and grace.
- But with crisis comes an opportunity to find new meaning. Old wounds may become
  new openings. One can see the world through the eyes of the heart.
- These films are meant to honor a community built on strength and fellowship. They're
  intended to remind each of us that we're never alone.
- We hope they can inspire conversation, open doors to new emotions, and remind us
  that joy can always be found in unexpected ways.

  description: 'A Modicum Of Joy is a modern film that explores the intersection of
    art and medicine in the face of a serious illness. The documentary follows Nashville
    photographer Fred Dusel II as he considers the role of palliative care in managing
    his own disease: metastatic lung cancer. Fred reminds us that wisdom can be found
    between the hollows of hope, ritual and the arts. The film offers a novel platform
    for outreach and education.'

  description: Intentional Healing is a restorative documentary that follows the famed
    Nashville music producer Jesse Boyce as he contemplates his own mortality following
    a diagnosis of terminal prostate cancer. He returns to the studio as an artist,
    producer and mentor to compose one last song with Black Violin. The film demonstrates
    the healing power of music and candidly depicts 21st-century cancer care in Music
    City. To Jesse, hope is a lasting belief that life will be fine regardless of
    the outcome; joy is independent of the journey.
