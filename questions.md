intro:
  paragraph: Thinking about what matters most in your life and sharing your hopes
    and fears will give you more control over the care you receive in the future.
    It will also help your loved ones to make decisions for you if you can’t make
    them at some point down the road.<br><br> This is the beginning of an ongoing
    discussion, however, we believe that individuals  who think about what is important
    to them often feel more control of their situation, feel less anxious and reach
    a sense of peace.
  quote: To speak of sorrow works upon it, Moves it from its crouched place, barring
    the way to and from the soul’s hall<br><br>- Denise Levertov
